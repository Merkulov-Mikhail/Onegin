In the land of dreams we wander free,
Where skies are painted with shades of glee.
A thousand stars twinkle in the night,
Guiding us with their celestial light.
Whispers of love float on the breeze,
Caressing our souls with gentle ease.
The moon smiles down, a radiant face,
Casting its glow upon this sacred space.
Fields of flowers dance in perfect rhyme,
Their petals swaying to the rhythm of time.
Birds serenade with their melodic song,
Filling the air as we stroll along.
Mountains stand tall, majestic and grand,
Guarding the beauty of this enchanted land.
Rivers flow with a graceful grace,
Carving their path with a gentle embrace.
The sun shines bright, a beacon of hope,
Warming our hearts as we learn to cope.
Laughter echoes through the open air,
A symphony of joy beyond compare.
Whispers of secrets shared in hushed tones,
Creating bonds that cannot be undone.
Friendship blooms like a delicate flower,
Nurtured by trust, growing stronger by the hour.
Life's tapestry woven with threads of gold,
Stories untold waiting to unfold.
A thousand dreams within our reach,
As we journey through this poetic speech.
So let us revel in this poetic bliss,
Immersed in a world where words never miss.
A thousand lines, a thousand tales,
In this poetic symphony that never fails.
Sun of the sleepless! Melancholy star!
Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
That show'st the darkness thou canst not dispel,
How like art thou to joy remember'd well!
So gleams the past, the light of other days,
Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays;
A night-beam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
Distinct, but distant â€” clear, but oh, how cold!
What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.
No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows.
No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.
No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.
No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.
No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began.
A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.
Life, believe, is not a dream
So dark as sages say;
Oft a little morning rain
Foretells a pleasant day.
Sometimes there are clouds of gloom,
But these are transient all;
If the shower will make the roses bloom,
Oh, why lament its fall?
Rapidly, merrily,
Life's sunny hours flit by,
Gratefully, cheerily,
Enjoy them as they fly!
What though Death at times steps in
And calls our best away?
What though sorrow seems to win,
O'er hope, a heavy sway?
Yet Hope again elastic springs,
Unconquered, though she fell;
Still buoyant are her golden wings,
Still strong to bear us well.
Manfully, fearlessly,
The day of trial bear,
For gloriously, victoriously,
Can courage quell despair!
If I had two nickels to rub together,
I would rub them together
Like a kid rubs sticks together
Until friction made combustion
And they burned a hole in my pocket
Into which I would put my hand
And then my arm
And eventually my whole self.
I would fold myself
Into the hole in my pocket and disappear
Into the pocket of myself, or at least my pants,
But before I did
Like some ancient star,
I'd grab your hand.
When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep.
How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face.
And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
I cannot ease your aching heart,
Nor take your pain away,
But let me stay and take your hand
And walk with you today!
I'll listen when you need to talk,
I'll wipe away your tears,
I'll share your worries when they come,
I'll help you face your fears.
I'm here, and I will stand by you
On each hill you have to climb.
So take my hand, let's face the world
And live one day at a time!
You're not alone, for I'm still here.
I'll go that extra mile.
And when your grief is easier,
I'll help you learn to smile.
I have a friend
Whose name is...
And we have fun together.
We laugh and play
And sing all day
In any kind of weather.
Have an amazing birthday,
Have a wonderful life every day,
May you have plans of success
And try to avoid making a mess.
Save problems with the "cold" reaction,
Take from love hot satisfaction.
May all your dreams come true!
All the best! Happy Birthday to you!
I wish you wisdom for right decisions,
I wish you savvy to reach success.
Let all your finance be risen,
Wishing good luck and happiness.
Be strong and healthy, don't ever change,
Let true friends be beside you always.
Don't pay attention to your age,
Enjoy your life and Happy Birthday!
Birthday girl, today's your day!
Time to eat cake, sing songs and play.
There are so many ways to have birthday fun.
Here's hoping you get to do every one!
Come, children, gather round my knee,
Something is about to be.
Tonight's December thirty-first,
Something is about to burst.
Hark! It's midnight, children dear.
Duck! Here comes another year.
New Year's Day, a happy day!
We are glad and want to play.
We all dance and sing and say,
